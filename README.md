# ðŸ§  Intelligent Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic
This project detects anomalous patterns in network traffic using machine learning techniques, with the goal of identifying potential threats such as intrusions and unusual flows in real-time.

#ðŸš€ Features
ðŸ“¥ Ingests network flow data (e.g., from Zeek, pcap, NetFlow)
ðŸ§® Extracts statistical features from flows or sessions
ðŸ¤– Applies machine learning models (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoder) to detect anomalies
ðŸ”” Flags high-risk traffic for alerting or review
ðŸ“Š (Optional) Web dashboard for real-time anomaly monitoring and feedback
